If anyone makes changes to a files in the group1_server files then the changes will only take eefect after running the command:
	python manage.py migrations
Then if you run python manage.py runserver you can see your changes.

Also note that the files in group1_server/proj2 is the core of the application where the settings are defined and where all apps are routed to in the urls.py file.
If you want to add another app (an app is jus another component/functionality to the applicatin eg. accounts, posts, profiles ...) then the command:

	python manage.py startapp 'appname'

should be run to make a new folder containing default files with the folder name being 'appname'. Then to connect the app to the core folder proj2 you must  create and edit a file named urls.py in the 'appname' folder that you previously created and place in it a url pattern (details can be found in djangos documentaion, just Google it) like in the already created accounts/urls.py file.
